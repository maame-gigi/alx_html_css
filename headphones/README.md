# Headphones Landing Page (Work In Progress)

This is a landing page project for a headphone brand, based on a provided Figma design.



**Design Requirements** 

These are the core visual and behavior rules I’ll be implementing:

- The webpage must switch to the mobile version when screen width is *480px or less*
- All *links* on hover/active must use color: `#FF6565`
- All *buttons* on hover/active must have `opacity: 0.9`
- The *max width* of the content must be `1000px` and centered on the page

**Planned Structure**

- `index.html` — Main HTML
- `styles.css` — Styling
- `README.md` — This file
- `images/` — Image assets (if any)

**Design Reference**

All layout and styles will follow the provided Figma design file. Some values in the design are float-based, so I’ll round them where necessary.

**Status**

Project setup is underway. I'll update this README with full technical breakdown once the page is built.

Built with ❤️ as part of the learning process with ALX.
